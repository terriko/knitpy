KnitPy is a free knitting chart making tool, written in Python

## Why?

Knitting chart applications exist, but I haven't seen an open source one 
that did what I wanted, which is to let me pixel-art up a chart and have it
generate a written pattern that matches (or vice versa, where you do the
written pattern and it generates the chart).

Knitting and programming, as far as I can tell, take similar parts of your
brain.  If you can decipher a pattern, you know how to read what is basically
an algorithm, if you know how to write a pattern, you are basically writing
code.  If you can fix a mistake in your knitting, you probably have the
mindset necessary for debugging.  I know lots of engineers who can also knit,
and many of us would be happy to know more people with both skills.  So I
thought it might be fun to have a knitting tool that is also suitable as a
starting project for knitters who might want to whet their feet on an easy
open source project.  

I don't know if that will work out, but I *do* want a hackable knitting chart
application, and hopefully some other folk will want such a thing enough to
help!

## Getting started

Right now, this doesn't do anything, but you can watch it draw lines by
running knitpy.py from the command line:

	python3 knitpy.py

Hopefully soon it will be cooler!
